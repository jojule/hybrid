<h1>Client-side Connector Example with Offline</h1>

<p>This example has been completely implemented on the client-side.</p>

<p>It consists of the following classes:
<ul>
	<li>AddressbookEditor: UI implementation compiled to JavaScript. Uses RPC to communicate with ClientSideAddressbookGWTRPCView.</li>
	<li>AddressbookEditorServerRpc: RPC interface which AddressbookEditor uses to communicate with ClientSideAddressbookGWTRPCView (client to server).</li>
	<li>AddressbookEditorClientRpc: RPC interface which ClientSideAddressbookGWTRPCView uses to communicate with AddressbookEditor (server to client).</li>
	<li>AddressbookEditorState: Contains addresses which are automatically synchronized (server to client).</li>
	<li>AddressbookView: Server-side view that puts the widget on the page. Handles RPC calls from AddressBookEditor and forwards to the backend</li>
	<li>AddressbookConnector: Initializer for the client-side widget.</li>
</ul>
</p>
